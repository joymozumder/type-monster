                <h3 class="green"><strong>Question: </strong>What are the differences between Local Storage and Session Storage?</h3>
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> <br>
                    <strong>Local Storage: </strong>
                    Local storage is useful for storing data that the user will need to access later, such as offline data. The stored data is not deleted when the browser is closed. It allows 10MB of data to be stored. <br> <br>
                    <strong>Session Storage: </strong>
                    Session storage is useful for storing data that is sensitive, such as login credentials. The data is stored only for the session and will be deleted when the browser is closed. It allows 5MB of data to be stored.

                <h3 class="green"><strong>Question: </strong>What are the differences between Global Scope and Block Scope?</h3>
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> <br>
                    <strong>Global Scope: </strong>
                    Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope. Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program. Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared outside a block. <br> <br>
                    <strong>Block Scope: </strong>
                    Block scope restricts the variable that is declared inside a specific block, from access by the outside of the block. The
                    let & const keyword facilitates the variables to be block scoped. Variables declared with the var keyword, do not have block scope.

                <h3 class="green"><strong>Question: </strong>how does the event loop work in javascript?</h3>
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> <br>
                    JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code, collecting and
                    processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks. The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop. Each event is just a function callback.

                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> <br>
                    There are 8 ways to get Undefined: <br>
                    <ol type="i">
                        <li>Variable that is not initialized will give undefined.</li>
                        <li>Function with no return.</li>
                        <li>Parameter that is not passed will be undefined.</li>
                        <li>If return has nothing on the right side will return undefined.</li>
                        <li>Property that doesn't exists on an object will give you undefined.</li>
                        <li>Accessing array elements outside of the index range.</li>
                        <li>Deleting an element inside an array.</li>
                        <li>Set a value directly to undefined.</li>
